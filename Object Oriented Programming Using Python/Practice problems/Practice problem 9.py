Problem Statement
Informatica, a consultancy services company has planned to offer cashless transaction service to its employees. The employees can use their smart cards any transaction (credit/debit).
Write a python program to implement the class diagram given below.

Class description

SmartCard class:
    set_account_balance(account_balance): Initialize account_balance to 500.

Employee class:
validate_employee_id(): Employee id should be in the range of 1000 (not inclusive) to 700000(inclusive). If valid return true. Else return false
validate_card_no(): Validate employee's smart card number.
Smart card number should have 9 characters
It should begin with "INF" and
It should not contain alphabets in any other positions
    If the above rules are satisfied, return true. Else return false

Transaction class:
top_up_card(employee, amount): Accept the object of the employee whose smart card should be topped up with given amount.
If the given amount is between 500 and 10000 (both inclusive),
If employee.employee_id and employee.smart_card.card_no are valid, add the given amount to employee.smart_card.account_balance
Else, return -1
Else, return -1
make_payment(employee,amount): Debit the given amount from the employeeâ€™s smart card and auto-generate attribute transaction_id starting with "T" followed by first digit of the employee id and first two numeric values of the card number, if the below rules are satisfied
Enough balance should be present in employee's smart card
employee.employee_id and employee.smart_card.account_balance should be valid
It should be possible to maintain minimum balance of Rs.500 in the smart card even after the transaction is made
      If any of the above rules are not satisfied, return -1

Perform case sensitive string comparison.
Create an object of SmartCard class, create an object of Employee using the SmartCard object.
Create objects of Transaction class for the Employee object, invoke make_payment() and top_up_card() methods and display the details.
