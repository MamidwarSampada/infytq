Problem Statement
An IT company wants to automate the process of allocating projects to its employees.
Write a python program to implement the class diagram given below.

Class description

Employee:
Initialize static variable, employee_count to 1000
generate_employee_id(): Auto-generate attribute, employee_id starting from 'E1001' ('E1001','E1002','E1003'â€¦etc)

Project:
update_number_of_employees(): Increment attribute, number_of_employees by 1

Department:
dep_project_list: Static list of Project objects which are in this department. Initialize it to an empty list.
employee_dict: Static dictionary which contains the employee id as key and corresponding project_id as value. Initialize it to an empty dictionary.
add_project(project_list): Accept a list of projects to be added to the department.
Append the projects in the project list to static list, dep_project_list, if the total number of projects is not more than 5 (existing projects + new projects waiting to be added)
Otherwise, return -1
add_employee(employee,project_id): Accept the object of the Employee who should be added to the given project_id.
If the given project is not available in the department, display appropriate message and return -1
A project can have maximum 10 employees. If the number of employees in the given project is already 10, then display an error message and return -2
Otherwise,
Generate employee id by invoking Employee.generate_employee_id() method
Add the employee to the given project by adding the employee_id as key and project_id as value in employee_dict
Increment the number of employees in the given project by invoking Project.update_number_of_employees() method
Perform case sensitive string comparison.
Create objects of Project class. Create a list of projects and add it to department by invoking add_project() method. Also add employees to the projects in the department by invoking add_employee() method and test your program.
