Problem Statement
Spice Hut is a tiffin service provider which home delivers dinner to their customers â€“ Occasional customers and Regular customers. 
Write a Python program to implement class diagram given below.
Class Description:

OccasionalCustomer class:
Initialize static variable counter to 1000
Inside the constructor, auto-generate bill_id starting from 1001 prefixed by "O"
validate_distance_in_kms(): Validate distance in kms
Delivery distance in kms should be between 1 and 5 (both inclusive)
If so, return true. Else, return false

Distance in kms                                Delivery charge in Rs.

Between 1 and 2(both inclusive)                  Rs. 5 per km

Between 2 and 5(excluding 2,including 5)         Rs. 7.5 per km

4. calculate_bill_amount(): Calculate total bill amount
Validate distance in kms
If valid, compute bill amount based on details mentioned below
Occasional customers can order only one tiffin per person
Cost/tiffin is Rs. 50
Delivery charges based on distance is as mentioned in the table
Bill amount includes tiffin cost and delivery charge
Set attribute, bill_amount with the computed bill amount value and return it
If invalid, set attribute, bill_amount as -1 and return it

RegularCustomer class:
Initialize static variable counter to 100
Inside the constructor, auto-generate bill_id starting from 101 prefixed by "R"
validate_no_of_tiffin(): Validate number of tiffins
Regular customer can order a min of 1 and a max of 7 tiffins
If value of no_of_tiffins is valid, return true. Else, return false
calculate_bill_amount(): Calculate weekly bill amount
Validate number of tiffins
If valid, compute bill amount based on details mentioned below
Cost/tiffin is Rs. 50
The order is applicable for all the 7 days of a week
Compute the bill amount based on cost/tiffin, number of tiffins and number of days
Set attribute, bill_amount with the computed bill amount value and return it
If invalid, set attribute, bill_amount as -1 and return it
Note: Perform case sensitive string comparison 

For testing:
Create objects of OccasionalCustomer and RegularCustomer classes
Invoke calculate_bill_amount() on OccasionalCustomer and RegularCustomer objects
Display the details of the customer
