Problem Statement
ARS builders has the plan of constructing new buildings with the sections of land they have. Each section has 2 plots on either sides of the road.
Given an input number of sections . The task is to find out all the possible ways for constructing buildings in the plots such that there is a space between any 2 buildings.
Note:
A new building can be placed on a section if the section just before it has space. A space can be placed anywhere (it doesnâ€™t matter whether the previous section has a building or not).
Write a python function to return the total number of possible ways for constructing the buildings.

Sample Input           Expected Output

n- 3                       25
Example:
No of sections=3,which means possible ways for one side are BSS, BSB, SSS, SBS, SSB where B represents a building and S represents an empty space. Total possible ways are 25, because a way to place on one side can correspond to any of 5 ways on other side.
Possible ways of constructing the buildings: 25
