"""
Problem Statement
Write a python function which accepts a given number, n and returns the count of all possible distinct binary strings which are of length n, such that there are no consecutive 1â€™s in the binary string.

Sample Input      Expected Output
n=2                    3
n=5                    5
Note: The possible binary strings when n= 2 are 00, 01 and 10 and the possible strings when n=3 are 000,001,010,100,101.
