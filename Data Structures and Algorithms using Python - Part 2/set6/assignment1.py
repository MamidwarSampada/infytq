Problem Statement
Given a list of digits. The task is to find out the number of possible decoding of the given digit sequence.
Assume that the input list contains valid digits from 0 to 9 and there are no leading 0's, no trailing 0's and no two or more consecutive 0's in the input list.
Let 1 represent 'A', 2 represent 'B', â€¦, 26 represent 'Z'.
Write a python function which accepts the list of digits and returns the total number of decoding possible from given digit sequence.

Sample Input                     Expected Output                                 Remark

digit_list=[1 ,2 ,2 ,4]                5                           The possible decoding are "ABBD", "LBD", "AVD", "ABX","LX"

digit_list=[1 ,2 ,2]                   3                            The possible decoding are "ABB", "LB", "AV"
